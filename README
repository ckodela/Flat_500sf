A city apartment with many suburban features.

This is a relatively small one-bedroom apartment with a large utility and laundry room, as well as a decent sized kichen. 
It has a balcony and a dining room as well as a living area just in front of the foyer. 
It's only 500 square feet, because I wanted to see if I could implement all of the amenities of a typical suburban house into a more compact space that would allow it to be placed in a city.
